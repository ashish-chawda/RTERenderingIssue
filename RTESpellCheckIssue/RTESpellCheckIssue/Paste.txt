I attended at 10 AM and met with Mr. and Mrs. asdd with asfaf from asfaf. Water damage was detected in the basement suite where the main water shut off is located. There is detectible moisture readings in the bathroom on the main floor, which is directly above this area as well as the bathroom on the top floor with just also about this area. Moisture readings were detected within the top floor, standing shower, approximately 1 foot up from the base. There are two possible causes. Either the suppl sdfsdfy line in the top floor bathroom has failed or the rubber membrane servicing, the tiled shower base. Water was detected also in the living room, hardwood floor at an exterior wall and we cannot be sure yet if the wall I wet because it is constructed of wallpaper and plaster. Because there may be a situation where the loss might not be covered (failed grout/rubber membrane) I have requested X call X mechanical to do a non destructive inspection to confirm if the leak is caused by the supply line or the shower drain. The Insured previously had X plumbing out to do an inspection, but they did not do any pressure testing and their findings did not conclude, but only suspected a water supply issue. They did not comment on the membrane possibility. Since I am not comfortable extending coverage without a confirmation of the cause of the leak, especially where there may be an off coverage position taken I have given these instructions to Bill us directly for the plumbing investigation which I will pay as an expense. I discuss this procedure and coverage at length with both of the Insureds and it was an hour and a half site meeting. The home has three bathrooms, but the water is currently shut off while we do not know the cause of the leak. I would normally not consider a lead, however, given the circumstances of the insured not getting immediate X service. When they contacted the branch, I will extend ALE until the water is restored.
The insured has indicated that the wood floor on the main and top floor is original too. It's Construction in the late 1800s and is made of Fir. Sum of the interior wall finishes are also original and identified to be a plaster type material.
The risk is a three level, wood frame, single-family dwelling that was built in 1897. It is approximately 2615 sq ft and is adequately maintained. The basement floor finishes look to of been installed in the early 2000s.
